# IPSC-analysis
Code to reproduce IPSC analysis by Untiet, Beinlich, Kusk, Ladr√≥n-de-Guevara, Song, Kjaerby, Andersen, Hauglund, Bojarowska, Sigurdsson, Deng, Hirase, Petersen, Verkhratsky, and Nedergaard (2023) 

The code is ordered into folders with "scripts" containing scripts used for analysis and "functions" containing custom functions that are used in the scripts.

The script requires the Signal Processing Toolkit (Butter and filtfilt). The script requires the following functions: abfload, triggerplot, TiggerPoints, and TriggerPointsEnd.
The function abfload has been published before: https://github.com/fcollman/abfload. All other functions are provided here with the script.
